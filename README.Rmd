## Introduction

The goal of the impectR package is to provide an easy way for Impect
Customers to access data from the customer API. This API includes basic
information about competitions, competition iterations, and matches as
well as event data and aggregated scorings per player and position on
match and season level.

## Installation

You can install the latest version of impectR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ImpectAPI/impectR@v2.4.3")
```

## Usage

### Getting started

Before accessing any data via our API, you will need to request a bearer
token for authorization. You can get this authorization token using the
following code snippet:

```{r accessToken, eval=FALSE}
library(impectR)

# define login credentials
username <- "yourUsername"
password <- "yourPassword"

# get access token
token <- getAccessToken(username = username, password = password)
```

This access token is a requirement to use any of the functions that
requests data from the API. We recommend to first get a list of
competition iterations that are enabled for your account.

### Retrieve Basic Information

```{r competition iterations, eval=FALSE}
# get list of iterations
iterations <- getIterations(token = token)

# print iterations to console
iterations
```

If any iteration you were expected to see is not listed, please contact
your sales representative. Now let’s assume you are interested in data
for 2022/23 season of the 1. Bundesliga (iteration = 518). The following 
snippet gets you a list of matches for this iteration:

``` {r match plan, eval=FALSE}
# get matches for iteration
matches <- getMatches(iteration = 518, token = token)

# print matches to console
matches
```

The column `available` denotes whether a given match has been tagged by Impect
and the data is available to you.

### Retrieve Match Level Data

Let's assume you are interested in the FC Bayern München vs Borussia Dortmund 
game from April 1st 2023 (matchId = 84344) and want to retrieve event level data
as well as team formation, starting position and substitution data. As the 
functions allows for multiple games to be requested at once, we need to wrap the
matchId into a list. Hence, to request data for this game, run the following 
code snippet:

```{r events, eval=FALSE}
# define matches to get event data for
matchIds <- c(84344)

# get event data for match
events <- getEvents(
  matches = matchIds,
  token = token,
  include_kpis = TRUE,
  include_set_pieces = TRUE
  )

# get match info
formations = getFormations(matches, token)
substitutions = getSubstitutions(matches, token)
starting_positions = getStartingPositions(matches, token)

# print first few rows from events dataframe to console
head(events)
```

You can access the aggregated KPIs, scores and ratios per player and position or
per squad for this match in a similar way. You can also find more detailed data
around set piece situations within our API.
Also, we provide you with IMPECT scores and ratios that you might know from our 
Scouting and Analysis portals. On player level, these are calculated across 
positions which is why you have to supply the function with a list of positions 
your want to retrieve data for:

```{r matchsums, eval=FALSE}
# define matches to get further data for
matchIds <- c(84344)

# get set piece data including KPI aggregates
setPieces <- getSetPieces(matches = matchIds, token = token)


# get kpi matchsums for match per player and position
playerMatchsums <- getPlayerMatchsums(matches = matchIds, token = token)

# get kpi matchsums for match per squad
squadMatchsums <- getSquadMatchsums(matches = matchIds, token = token)

# define positions to get scores aggregated by
positions <- c("LEFT_WINGBACK_DEFENDER", "RIGHT_WINGBACK_DEFENDER")

# get player scores and ratios for match and positions per player
playerMatchScores <- 
  getPlayerMatchScores(matches = matchIds, positions = positions, token = token)

# get squad scores and ratios for match per squad
squadMatchScores <- getSquadMatchScores(matches = matchIds, token = token)
```

In case you wish to retrieve data for multiple matches, we suggest using
the following method to do so in order to minimize the amount of
requests sent to the API. Let’s also get the event data for the RB
Leipzig vs FSV Mainz 05 game (matchId = 84350) from the same day:

```{r multiple matches, eval=FALSE}
# define list of matches
matchIds <- c(84344, 84350)

# get event data for matches
events <- getEvents(
    matches = matchIds, 
    token = token,
    include_kpis = True,
    include_set_pieces = True
)

# get set piece data including KPI aggregates
setPieces <- getSetPieces(ip.getSetPieces(matches = matchIds, token = token)
                            
# get matchsums for matches per player and position
playerMatchsums <- getPlayerMatchsums(matches = matchIds, token = token)

# get matchsums for matches per squad
squadMatchsums <- getSquadMatchsums(matches = matchIds, token = token)

# define positions to get scores aggregated by
positions <- c("LEFT_WINGBACK_DEFENDER", "RIGHT_WINGBACK_DEFENDER")

# get player scores and ratios for match and positions per player
playerMatchScores <- 
  getPlayerMatchScores(matches = matchIds, positions = positions, token = token)

# get squad scores and ratios for match per squad
squadMatchScores <- getSquadMatchScores(matches = matchIds, token = token)

```

### Retrieve Iteration Level Data

Starting from API version V5, we also offer an endpoint to get KPI average values
per iteration on player as well as squad level. These averages are calculated by
dividing the kpi sum of all individual matches by the sum of matchShares the player
accumulated at a given position. On a team level we divide the score by the 
amount of matches played by the team.
Also, we provide you with IMPECT scores and ratios that you might know from our 
Scouting and Analysis portals. On player level, these are calculated across 
positions which is why you have to supply the function with a list of positions 
your want to retrieve data for.
Let's assume you were interested in wingbacks in the 2022/2023 Bundesliga season, 
then you could use this code snippet:

```{r season averages, eval=FALSE}
# define iteration ID
iteration <- 518

# define positions to get scores aggregated by
positions <- c("LEFT_WINGBACK_DEFENDER", "RIGHT_WINGBACK_DEFENDER")

# get player kpi averages for iteration
playerIterationAverages <-
  getPlayerIterationAverages(iteration = iteration, token = token)

# get squad kpi averages for iteration
squadIterationAverages <-
  getSquadIterationAverages(iteration = iteration, token = token)

# get player scores and ratios for iteration and positions
playerIterationScores <- 
  getPlayerIterationScores(iteration = iteration, positions = positions, token = token)

# get squad scores and ratios for iteration
squadIterationScores <- 
  getSquadIterationScores(iteration = iteration, token = token)

# get squad ratings for iteration
squadRatings <- getSquadRatings(iteration = iteration, token = token)

```


Please keep in mind that Impect enforces a rate limit of 10 requests per second
per user. A token bucket logic has been implemented to restrict the amount of API
calls made on the client side already. The rate limit is read from the first limit 
policy sent back by the API, so if this limit increases over time, this package will
act accordingly.
